# Workshops & Short Courses in Infectious Disease Modeling

## International Clinics on Infectious Disease Dynamics and Data Program (ICI3D)

Typically Africa-based for in-person, but all materials freely available. Main relevant workshops:

 - Clinic on Dynamical Approaches to Infectious Disease Data,
 [DAIDD](http://www.ici3d.org/daidd/): "DAIDD is a week-long modeling clinic that provides an introduction to dynamical models used in the study of infectious disease dynamics. Instruction focuses on the conceptual foundations of modeling and model formulation for infectious disease research."
 - Clinic on Meaningful Modeling of Epidemiological Data [MMED](http://www.ici3d.org/mmed/): "MMED is a 2-week modeling clinic that emphasizes the use of data in understanding infectious disease dynamics. Participants conduct modeling projects informed by epidemiological data that address practical questions in a meaningful way."

## London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)

## The Summer Institute in Statistics and Modeling in Infectious Diseases (SISMID)
[Overview from website](https://sph.emory.edu/SISMID/index.html): "SISMID is designed to introduce infectious disease researchers to modern methods of statistical analysis and mathematical modeling." Typically held in July in Atlanta, though some remote courses.

 - 16 modules offered (some running concurrently) and each is 2.5 days; [schedule here](https://sph.emory.edu/SISMID/modules/index.html)

## Duke University Network Analysis Center

[Social Networks and Health Workshop](https://sites.duke.edu/dnac/training/)

Topics include: Network data collection and analytic approaches, statistical
models for networks, stochastic agent-based models, ethics in social networks
research.

Typically held in May in Durham.
